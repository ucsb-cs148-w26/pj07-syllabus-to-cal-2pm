# Syllabus to Calendar App 
Our Syllabus to Calendar app is an iOS app that takes in a user's syllabi and exports the important due dates, such as exams, homeworks, and more, to their Google Calendar. 

A student can:
- Upload syllabi as a picture or PDF
- Provide feedback if the syllabi-to-calendar conversion isn't entirely correct
- Edit/accept/decline color-coded events
- Log into Google account
- Specify which syllabi corresponds to which class (color/label)

## Tech Stack
We will be using:
- Swift (primarily for frontend development)
- SQLite (for database)
- Python (for backend development)
- Google OAuth (to connect accounts to calendar)
- Google Calendar API (RESTful API for defining endpoints)

## User Roles and Permissions
TBA 🙃

## Deployment 
Since we are building an iOS app, we use the simulator on Xcode to test/view our app's functionality.
