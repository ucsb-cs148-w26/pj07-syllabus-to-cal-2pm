Uses ChatGPT for syntax lookup, debugging, and suggestions.

However, ChatGPT, or any LLM in general, is still prone to hallucination. Thus, I need to double check every code it says to make sure it doesn't break the code. And, I do not trust Codex to directly edit my files, so I manually prompt ChatGPT and copy paste useful code snippets back to my code.
