Hi, I'm Divya! I'm a third-year computer science major whose primary research interests lie in machine learning and information retrieval. 

For the project, I would like to incorporate two syllabus uploading features into our iOS application: (1) a PDF upload option, and (2) a camera scanning feature for paper syllabi. I would also like to color code/group syllabus events by class.
