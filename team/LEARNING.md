# Learning Plan

Our team is building **Syllabus to Calendar**, an iOS app that parses course syllabi and syncs important dates to Google Calendar. The team has **seven members** with varying levels of experience across iOS development, backend development, APIs, and databases.

Overall, some team members have prior experience with mobile or backend development, while others are newer to these technologies. Most of the team has limited experience with **Swift/SwiftUI**, **FastAPI**, and **Google OAuth / Calendar APIs**, so these will be new learning areas for many of us.

Rather than relying on instruction from the course staff, we plan to learn through:
- Official documentation (Apple Developer Docs, FastAPI docs, Google API docs)
- Small prototypes and experiments
- Pairing experienced members with less experienced members
- Assigning people to components they are interested in learning, while maintaining collaboration and shared understanding

We recognize that learning as a team is as important as learning the technologies themselves. Members with more experience will focus on helping others ramp up, while newer members will focus on understanding the fundamentals and asking questions early.

## Individual Learning & Responsibility Plan

**Matthew Blanke**  
Will focus on learning SwiftUI and frontend development for iOS, working on UI components such as login and task display screens.

**Arya Sadeghi**  
Will work on syllabus parsing logic, learning PDF text extraction, regex-based date parsing, and data normalization.

**Yuhang Jiang**  
Will work on the backend endpoints and communications: monitoring SQLite database storage and queries, manage OAuth and Google Calendar API, research potential options to train our own parser model, research hosting options that can run our database and model.

**Divyani Punj**  
Will work on the frontend using Swift, create wireframes for the some of the pages, work on the backend for Google Calendar (API) integration.

**Jiaming Liu**  
Will contributue to backend implementation: designing and implementing the outermost FastAPI endpoints, contributing to SQLite database engineering for storing user accounts and other information, contribute to other modules flexibly.

**Divya Subramonian**  
Will work on frontend development (as I have some prior experience), and will focus on backend and a little bit of OAuth as we move into creating and integrating Google Calendar events.

**Avaneesh Vinoth Kannan**  
Will work on learning iOS app development as a whole, also learn more about API integration.

## Team Learning Strategy

- Hold short internal check-ins to share what each person has learned
- Maintain shared documentation for setup, APIs, and common pitfalls
- Encourage pair programming when tackling unfamiliar tools
- Prioritize understanding the full workflow rather than isolated components

By distributing responsibilities while encouraging collaboration, we aim to both complete a working MVP and ensure that all team members gain meaningful experience with the chosen technology stack.
