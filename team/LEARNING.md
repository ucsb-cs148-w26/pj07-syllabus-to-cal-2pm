# Learning Plan

Our team is building **Syllabus to Calendar**, an iOS app that parses course syllabi and syncs important dates to Google Calendar. The team has **eight members** with varying levels of experience across iOS development, backend development, APIs, and databases.

Overall, some team members have prior experience with mobile or backend development, while others are newer to these technologies. Most of the team has limited experience with **Swift/SwiftUI**, **FastAPI**, and **Google OAuth / Calendar APIs**, so these will be new learning areas for many of us.

Rather than relying on instruction from the course staff, we plan to learn through:
- Official documentation (Apple Developer Docs, FastAPI docs, Google API docs)
- Small prototypes and experiments
- Pairing experienced members with less experienced members
- Assigning people to components they are interested in learning, while maintaining collaboration and shared understanding

We recognize that learning as a team is as important as learning the technologies themselves. Members with more experience will focus on helping others ramp up, while newer members will focus on understanding the fundamentals and asking questions early.

## Team Learning Strategy

- Hold short internal check-ins to share what each person has learned
- Maintain shared documentation for setup, APIs, and common pitfalls
- Encourage pair programming when tackling unfamiliar tools
- Prioritize understanding the full workflow rather than isolated components

By distributing responsibilities while encouraging collaboration, we aim to both complete a working MVP and ensure that all team members gain meaningful experience with the chosen technology stack.
