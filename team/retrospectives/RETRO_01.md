## Action item

* Goal: Start being more descriptive in PRs
* Change: Use more screenshots/videos of changes in PRs, especially in UI changes

## Optional

* The team should continue our effective communication through our group chat. This helps team members understand the current state of the team.

## Retro Assessment

* Our team used the Start/Stop/Continue retro outline. Each team member took some time to create their own items. Then we came together to discuss all the start/stop/continue items. We selected a few high-importance items to focus on for our next sprint. 
* Assesment: The retospective went well. All team members felt comfortable sharing their ideas. We were able to come to a conclusion effectively on what items we should focus on.
* Advice: I would tell a future retrospective leader to encourage everyone to speak, and allot every team member their own time to share their ideas. This creates a comfortable environment for team members focused on improvement.
