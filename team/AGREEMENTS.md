### (good practices for creating a harmonious productive team)

1. Try to minimize number of absences, and let everyone know as soon as possible if you can't make it
2. Make sure to complete an equal amount of code reviews
3. Help other team members when you can (everyone contributes to the team's success)
4. When someone is absent, make sure to fill them in as soon as possible
5. When differences arise, we will discuss the conflict and agree/compromise before moving on
6. Communicate! -- when you're struggling, make sure to ask for help (don't wait until the last minute)
