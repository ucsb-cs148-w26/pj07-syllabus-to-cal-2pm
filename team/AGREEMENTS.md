# AGREEMENTS
### (good practices for creating a harmonious productive team)

1. Try to minimize number of absences, and let everyone know as soon as possible (on EdStem or iMessage) if you can't make it
- If you can join virtually, we will hold a hybrid meeting over Zoom
2. Make sure to complete an equal amount of code reviews
- If you notice someone is contributing a significant amount, make sure to balance out the effort
3. Help other team members when you can (everyone contributes to the team's success)
- When you have finished your work, check in with everyone to ensure there are no blockers
4. When someone is absent, make sure to fill them in as soon as possible
- Send out meeting summaries after lecture/section on EdStem
5. When differences arise, we will discuss the conflict and agree/compromise before moving on
6. Communicate! -- when you're struggling, make sure to ask for help (don't wait until the last minute)
