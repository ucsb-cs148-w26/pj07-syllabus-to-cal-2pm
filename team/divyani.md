Hello! My name is Divyani. I'm a fourth year computer science student with an interest in computer architecture and machine learning.

Features I would like possibly like to see incorporated: 
* Color-coded events (e.g. projects, assignments, tests, lectures have their own distinct colors)
* An option to automatically set reminders/notifications for each type of event. If a grade breakdown is provided, events with higher weightings would trigger more reminders.
