# Matthew Blanke

Hi! My name is Matthew Blanke, and I am a third-year Computer Science transfer student. I’m interested in building practical software tools that reduce friction in students’ academic workflows.

For this project, our team is building a **mobile iOS app** that helps students automatically manage their coursework. Users can upload a course syllabus, and the app will parse important information such as assignments, exams, and deadlines. These events are then automatically added to the user’s **Google Calendar**, saving time and reducing the chance of missing important dates.

## Project Ideas

Some ideas I have for extending or improving the project include:

- **Smart syllabus parsing**: Handle multiple syllabus formats (PDFs, images, text) and gracefully deal with inconsistencies or missing information using NLP and pattern recognition.
- **Editable previews**: Show users a preview of extracted assignments and dates before syncing them to Google Calendar so they can confirm or edit entries.
- **Recurring reminders**: Automatically add reminders (e.g., 1 week and 1 day before deadlines) to help students stay on track.
- **Course organization**: Group calendar events by course with consistent colors or tags for better visual organization.
- **Change detection**: Allow users to re-upload an updated syllabus and automatically detect changes, updating the calendar accordingly.
- **Multiple calendar support**: Let users choose which calendar (school, personal, or custom) the events should be added to.
- **Privacy-focused design**: Ensure uploaded syllabi are processed securely and not stored longer than necessary.

The overall goal is to make the app reliable, flexible, and easy to use, while minimizing the manual effort required from students.
