Plannr is a student productivity app that parses course syllabi (PDFs) and automatically extracts assignments, deadlines, and events into a structured task list and calendar view.

## 2. Sprint 02 Issues/User Stories
- Add multiple syllabi
- Different file/input types
- Allow for .csv or .ics file type export
- Update UI
- Conflict detection, recurring event support, don't sync repeat events, etc.
- Make it so colors associated with events trasfer to GCal when syncing
- Syllabi history
- Add error message when someone uploads something that is not a syllabus (update Gemini prompt)
- Full pivot to Tasks API
- Settings page (default calendar, sign out/delete, default event colors, default calendar view, clear cached syllabi, export data, sync history)
- Rate limiting (prevent API abuse)
- Make it so user can sync to different calendars within their GCal
- Notofication-style sync confirmation (from top of screen)
- Canvas API integration???? (non file types, see users assignments, study session groups, etc.)
