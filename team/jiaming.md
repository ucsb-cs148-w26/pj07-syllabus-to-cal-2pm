Hello I am Jiaming, UCSB CS 2027

My idea for the project is just to:
1. User copy-paste their syllabus into the CLI
2. The CLI automatically asks the user to login in Google, and adds the appropriate times to their Google calendar
3. The appropriate times will be extracted from the syllabus via prompt engineering
