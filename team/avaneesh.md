Hi, I'm Avaneesh. I am a 3rd year computer science major.

I wanted to do this project because I think it is something that I would actually use in my life normally. 

Project Ideas:
    1. The project should be designed as an IOS app
    2. A pdf file should be able to be attached from the IPhone's files
    3. The application should support real time pictures using the IPhone's camera
    4. Appropriate times are extracted from media and the google calender is updated
